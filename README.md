# Stormeous
## _Champion select helper_


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/Panable/Stormeous/releases/tag/InitialVersion)

## Stormeous helps you:

- Auto accept ready checks
- See your teammates (even in ranked where their names are hidden)
- Copy their opgg's directly into your clipboard
- Horrible UI makes you feel very retro (will be updated inshallah ðŸ•Œ)

## Can man get banned?
Yeah you can, if you go around copy pasting their account names every lobby; which don't get me wrong, is a lot of fun (until riot police catch on). But seriously you can't get banned, all the calls are made locally on your machine, so it's all safe; just don't make it obvious you know who everyone is :)



## Tech
Stormeous is written in Python and all the code is open source. All the api calls being made to league of legends are actually all locally made; so nothing goes out to the internet when you use the application. Best part? No viruses like some other champ select helpers out there. Don't trust me? Read the code yourself; it's less than 300 lines. Build from source if you don't trust the builds.
